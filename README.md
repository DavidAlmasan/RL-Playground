# RL-Playground
This library aims to implement from scratch RL algorithms such as DQN, DDQN, A2C, A3C, etc. 

# ML Framework transfer
With recent work done on a project that relies on this library, there is an ongoing process of porting the code from Tensorflow to PyTorch. 

## Working algorithms under PyTorch
1. DQN
